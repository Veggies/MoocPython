#This lesson first introduces the while loop. The while loop will continue to do whatever it's
#coded to do until the action associate with a break is performed. The while loop, will, loop.
#You can use a break to allow voluntary exit, such as typing -1, or as a way to perform an 
#authentication check of sorts, such as requiring a certain unspecified phrase or number be
#entered.
 
#This program should print out the message "hi" and then ask "Shall we continue?" until the user
#inputs "no". Then the program should print out "okay then" and finish.

#while True:
#    print("hi")
#    hello = input(print("Should we continue?"))
#    if hello == 'no':
#        break
#print("okay then")
