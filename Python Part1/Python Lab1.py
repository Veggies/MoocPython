#This a python script I used for Part 1 of the Python Programming MOOC, offered by the
#University of Helsinki.

#This will print the minutes in a year
#print(365*24*60*60)


#This is a single quote lab, instead of using double quotation marks
#print('What a cool feature!')

#You can use single quotes ('') to put double quote marks ("") in a string
#print('"Well hello there!", said the officer.')
