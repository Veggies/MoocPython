#This line creates a variable defined as an integer.
#result = 10 * 25
#print(result)

#This line attempts to print a string and integer variable together, which is not possible and creates an error code.
#result=10*5
#print("The result is:"+result)

#This line correctly combines a string and integer together by casting the integer as a string with the str function.
#result=10*20
#print("The result is: "+ str(result))

#This line represents using a comma to combine different types of values (A string and an integer)
#result=10*2
#print("The result is: ",result)

#This a practice of using F-Strings. F-Strings can be used by placing an f at the beginning of the strings. This allows
#for different syntaxes(?) to be used together, IE a string and an integer
#result=10*3
#print(f"The results are: {result}")

#This is a lab from the course that initially was using commas to include different syntaxes. I have used fstrings to
#combine them.

#This lab defined two variables, x=27 & y=15 . It instructs the following equations be printed:
#27 + 15 = 42
#27 -15 = 12
#27 * 15 = 405
#27 / 15 = 1.8
#x=27
